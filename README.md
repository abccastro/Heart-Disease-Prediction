# Heart Disease Prediction

This program has used logistic regression, decision tree classifier and artificial intelligence algorithms with cross-validation to develop and train the models that could estimate the likelihood of heart disease based on important indicators associated with the condition. The model was then evaluated for its accuracy, precision, recall and auc scores. The model with highest scores in evaluation metrics is the one incorporated in the application to predict heart disease.

The dataset were obtained from the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease. We created synthetic samples as well to balance the data distribution among the predictor class.
